**Tech Stack**
- The project uses shadcn UI components, React Query for data fetching, and has a quota system for sent messages that's checked in /chat/route.ts.
- The project is built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase and PNPM, deployed on Vercel.
- Avoid using typescript / javascript / react logic when TailwindCSS (or inline styles if necessary) can solve the problem for the animations.

**Refactoring**
- You should as much as possible refactor into multiple functions
- Functions should have very detailed explicit names to improve maintanability and not needing comments
- If the logic is getting too complex, create new files and / or new components
- File names should be explicit and match the component name and not use PascalCase, use kebab-case instead
- Don't write any comments, the code should be self-explanatory and have very explicit names

**Legal**
- The Armony app needs legal pages (terms, conditions, privacy policy) updated to be relevant to the app's specific content and purpose.

**UI/UX**
- DialogContent components should include DialogTitle for accessibility, or use VisuallyHidden to hide it while maintaining screen reader access.
- The features should be UX first. Feel free to make any necessary changes to the UI/UX to improve the user experience.
- The UI is the most important part of the project. It should be somooth, having micro interactions, modern and easy to use.

**User Preference**
- The user prefers to handle running the application themselves and doesn't want the assistant to start the app after completing tasks.
